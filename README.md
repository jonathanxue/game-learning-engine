# Introduction

This is a 2D engine created for fun/learning. Only the source files are on the repo for anyone interested. This is still a WIP

# Summary
This engine uses an Entity Component System to manage game objects and the UI


# Upcoming

I will eventually create a blog to log progress of the engine and the associated game
